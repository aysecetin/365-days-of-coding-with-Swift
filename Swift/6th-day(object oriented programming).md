# OBJECT ORIENTED PROGRAMMING ðŸ’»

ðŸ¤“ object oriented programming is actually a philosophy. if we can establish this logic, our work will be much easier.   
what is this object oriented programming?  

- Our lives are built around objects.
- We abstract these objects and reflect them in software projects.
- Objects are abstracted and converted into computer code for multiple use. 
- The resulting abstract outline is called a class.

## what is the object?
- objects are the embodiment of classes.  
- objects have state and behaviour.  

**For example, a car;**  
ðŸš—speed capacity and colour: state  
ðŸ›»pedals for accelerating and decelerating: behaviour  

- classes contain details about the properties and behaviour of objects.
- e.g. what happens when the brake is applied  

## state and behaviour of objects 
**state**
classes can have one or more properties.
determines instance variables.
is carried along with the object.

**behaviour**   
classes can have one or more methods.  
a method represents a task within the programme   
- defines the steps by which the tasks are to be performed  
- hides complex operations from the user  
- calling the method causes the method to perform these operations
