# _CLOSURE_ 📂

- In simple terms, they are ready-made coding structures held together with parentheses.
- They are code structures that work like functions.
- It is the same as the lambda structure in Java and other languages.

```swift

let expression = {
    print(“welcome to closure.”)
}

expression()

let aggregation = {
    (sayi1:Int, sayi2:Int)->Int in
    return number1+number2
}

let result = sum(10,20)

print(result)
```
