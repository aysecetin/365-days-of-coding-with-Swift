## Variables
Variables are the most basic coding structure in all programming languages.  
Modern languages express the values stored in memory with variables.  
We do not need to specify a type for variables in Swift  


# Variable Definition

The following table describes how a variable is defined:

| Variable Token     | Variable Name | Assignment Operator | Variable Value  |
|--------------------|--------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| `var`              | `yas`        | `=`                  | `34`            |


This definition is made as follows:
```swift
var yas = 34
```
## Usage 

**String and Integer**
